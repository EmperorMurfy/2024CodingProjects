# 2024 Coding Projects

Coding projects written between late 2023 - 2024 while learning Java during AP Computer Science or self-teaching coding languages

The code in this repository are split into multiple different projects which I've either developed personally, or learned by watching tutorials or videos. Note: some of the code are not original code. **However, this does not apply to all of the code here!**

## Notes:
* These programs were tested on M1 Mac Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, or via Replit
* Each folder should contains a info.md - specific information regarding itself -> more detailed info
* Most Java programs were written via Java 1.8, check *Exceptions*
* **Java:** Exception: Stopwatch project uses Java 13
* **Javascript:** Exception: ArrayProject method nim() was translated 



## Instructions:
If you wish to use any of the code, follow the instructions:

1) Please select on the specific project you wish to run & download said folder

2) Depending on the project, create a new project in your workspace (eclipse or etc) with the correct version

3) The downloaded folder should contain only the SRC files & classes, drag that into your empty project's SRC. This may depend on the project. - only applicable w/ java
