# 2024 Java Projects

Coding projects written in Late 2023 - 2024 while learning Java during AP Computer Science

The code in this repository are split into multiple different projects which I've either developed personally, or learned by watching tutorials or videos. Some of the code are not original! This is simply code I've written as apart of my journey in learning Java. 

## Project List:
* [ArrayProject](https://github.com/EmperorMurfy/2024JavaProjects/tree/main/ArrayProject) - Written in Oct 10, 2023


## Notes:
* These programs were tested on M1 Mac Eclipse
* Most programs here uses Java 1.8, check Exceptions for any exclusions 
* Exception: the stopwatch project uses Java 13

## Instructions:
If you wish to use any of the code, follow the instructions:

1) please select on the specific folder & download said folder

2) Depending on the project, create a new project in your java workspace (eclipse) with the correct version

3) The downloaded folder should contain only the SRC files & classes, drag that into your empty project's SRC. This may depend on the project.
