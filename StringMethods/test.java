		String wordA = sc.nextLine();
		
		System.out.println("Please input a word B");
		String wordB = sc.nextLine();
		
		// Check if words are the same - would be implemented in main but also could work in article?  - > perhaps unnecessary...

		String regexB = "(?i)\\b" + wordB + "\\b";
		
		// Create a Temp Word to Replace Word A with
		String temp = "WORD A";

		// Note, it does seem to only detect the word if it is the exact same. 
		// Meaning that if you are trying to find "Example" and entered "example" it won't do anything. But if you enter "Example" it will. 

		sentenceEx = sentenceEx.replaceAll(regexA, temp); // Word A -> Temp
		sentenceEx = sentenceEx.replaceAll(regexB, wordA); // Word B -> Word A
		sentenceEx = sentenceEx.replaceAll(temp, wordB); // Tempt -> Word B or (Word A -> Temp -> Word B)
		
		// Print out final result, but would be returned instead of printed
		System.out.println(sentenceEx);
