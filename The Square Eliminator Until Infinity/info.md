# The Square Eliminator Until Infinity
Project written in February 12, 2024

Written in order to understand inheritance
Is a game where it involves the player to click on squares which bounce across the screen. There are also red squares which gain 5 points while other squares gains only one. But the red squares move 2x as fast and are harder to click. 

Every time you open the game, it randomizes the time till INFINITY. The countdown is on the upper left corner. After infinity counts to zero and towards the negatives, circles will spawn which when clicked, decrease your score by -1. 

There is no win/lose mechanism at the moment, although the idea is that you attempt to get the highest score (eliminations of squares) before the screen is covered with circles.
