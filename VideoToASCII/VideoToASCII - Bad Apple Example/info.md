#Video to ASCII - Bad Apple Example

Project written March 1, 2023

I did not write this code, I used examples and pieces of code from others. I'll try and find the source for credit.

In order to use this code to learn ASCII conversion, download these files and create a project using Java JRE 17.0.2 in your java program (eclipse), then upload res inside that folder, open the src in the downloaded folder and upload the contents into the java project src.
