Accepts two integer input in console, one as base, one as exponent
Run through a powerOf function, which the recursive function that accepts these two inputs as b + a
Replies with result when func end

Function superscript accepts an n parameter, and will return with it's superscripted form
The answer replied in main will print out b and a (a in superscript form) and the answer result by calling on powerOf function.
